# UnityGameFramework
Framework for Unity game development

This framework is a Unity Project skeleton for Unity 6 created to speed up the development process in Game Jams (games created using this framework can be found in my itch.io https://mraceituno.itch.io/).

This project consists in 5 scenes:
* Splash Art Scene: put the studio or game logo as the opening scene in your game
* Main Menu Scene: after a few seconds in the splash art scene, it will automatically move to the main menu where you can move to other scenes
* Game Scene: start developing your game with this initial scene
* Options Scene: basic options scene where you can change resolution, sound volume and fullscreen mode
* Credits Scene: give yourselves credit and some links to your other work

All these scenes should be fully customizable to the needs of your game but it should help you speed up, have a more professional skeleton to show and let you focus on design and gameplay.
